# expenses-tracker
###### I used React in making this app as a part of learning react course
###### this is just a front end application that is not connected to datadase yet but you can add expenses and see it added normally but once yout refresh it will be gone.
###### you can visualize the pattern of your expenses and filter it by year
###### it's not final product yet and i'm going to add more features in the future
